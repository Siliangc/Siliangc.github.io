<h1>Spiral Knights: a field and weapons manual</h1>
  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Siliang Chen, and I am a first-year student at the university at buffalo,
  CSE 199 student. I am also an aspiring game developer and a passionate gamer, with a love for 
  the online game Spiral Knights. That being said, I present to you: an introduction to this fascinating 
  game, along with a few gameplay tips from a veteran knight with many hours of gameplay experience.

  <h2>Early deployment</h2>
  <p>Perhaps you have never heard of the game Spiral Knights, or barely finished the tutorial when you stumbled upon this page. As an introduction, Spiral Knights is a multiplayer team based dungeon game. Despite the closed off dungeon aspect of the game, it maintains an atmosphere which creates a sensation of a open world game. With randomized levels and new parties every trip through this mechanical world, it keeps many players coming back for more. I highly recommend this game for its friendly nature and opportunities for social interaction, along with its late-game share of intensity for the more hardcore of gamers.
