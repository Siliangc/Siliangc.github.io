<h1>Spiral Knights: a field and weapons manual</h1>
  <h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Siliang Chen, and I am a first-year student at the university at buffalo,
  CSE 199 student. I am also an aspiring game developer and a passionate gamer, with a love for 
  the online game Spiral Knights. That being said, I present to you: an introduction to this fascinating 
  game, along with a few gameplay tips from a veteran knight with many hours of gameplay experience.
</p>
  
  <h2>Starting your adventure:</h2>
  <p>Perhaps you have never heard of the game Spiral Knights, or barely finished the tutorial when you stumbled upon this page. As an introduction, Spiral Knights is a multiplayer team based dungeon game. Despite the closed off dungeon aspect of the game, it maintains an atmosphere which creates a sensation of a open world game. With randomized levels and new parties every trip through this mechanical world, it keeps many players coming back for more. I highly recommend this game for its friendly nature and opportunities for social interaction, along with its late-game share of intensity for the more hardcore of gamers.

  <h2>Early deployment:</h2>
  <p>This guide will focus on making do with the second tier cobalt armor and weapons set, and not meant for a beginner fresh off the skylark. It is highly recommended that beginners continue to accept rank missions until being issued with these armaments. This guide is also mean for players with relatively few crowns and without a great deal of time available to invest in this game. Made it out of the soldier’s graveyard to earn your caliber sword? Then you may proceed.
  </p>
  <h2>Standard issue:</h2>
  <p>The cobalt armament set is one of the most versatile loadouts within the game, with later upgrades carrying its usefulness all the way towards the late game. It is also easily the most economical options for any knight in the field, being issued after a mission completion at no charge to the knight, and cheaper upgrades towards the late game. We will not discuss the specific numbers with the stats of these equipment, but rather tactic and mechanics which can be exploited to make the most of this loadout.

  <h2>The Caliber sword:</h2>
  <p>With early weapons being relatively weak, the sword is one of the best sources of damage early game, and continues to be a damage machine in single combat throughout the game. With a DPS rating above many other pieces of gear upon receipt, it also has a power charge attack that has the potential to one-hit enemies if used correctly. However, the caliber line of swords are sometimes frowned upon by other users for its lack of specialized damage type, being easily outclassed by other swords. But even more upsetting is it’s infamous charge attack’s knockback. The knockback from the charge attack of this weapon has the potential to put the lives of your party members in danger by knocking enemies right towards them in mid-attack.
